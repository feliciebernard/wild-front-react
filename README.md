# Getting Started with this React App

Welcome to the front wildbook app!
To start you need to pull two repositories:

- the front: `git clone https://github.com/feliciebernard/wild-front-react-ts-typegraphql.git`
- the back: [get to the back repository](https://github.com/feliciebernard/wild-back-node-ts-typegraphql.git)

If you have docker, get started-me just with one command! ==> `docker compose up --build`

If you don't have docker:

- `npm i`
- `npm start`
